In this notebook, we will use an R-group decomposition to perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset from the ChEMBL database. We will define a common scaffold for a set of molecules and use the function rdRGroupDecomposition.RGroupDecompose from the RDKit to create a table of substituents attached at different positions on the scaffold.
